React Counter [![Greenkeeper badge][greenkeeper-image]][greenkeeper-url] [![Build status][build-status-image]][build-status-url]
=============
Simple counter written in [TypeScript][typescript] using [React][react], [Redux][redux] and [Styled Components][styled-components].

Counts up and down, but never below zero. That's it ðŸ‘Œ

>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App][create-react-app].

Inspired by Microsoft's [TypeScript React Starter][typescript-react-starter].
